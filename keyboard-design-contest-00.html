Thank you to everyone who has participated in the contest! I am floored by all of the creativity and thought put into the entries!! I'd like to list out the entries, what I like about each one, and finally outline the winners. Thank you to PCBWay for sponsoring the prizes and making this contest possible!</p><h2>Context</h2><p>This <a href="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/pocket-keyboard-design-contest-00.html">contest</a> required participants to create a keyboard that was pocket sized and portable. Entries were evaluated on innovation, size and portability, viability, reproducibility, and presentation.</p><p>Each entry took a unique approach to being small while still being useable and attractive. Many entries also went to great lengths outlining how their designs can be reproduced. </p><h2>Entries (in no particular order)</h2><h3><a href="https://github.com/ParksDevelopment/2Pocket">2Pocket</a> (by ParksDevelopment)</h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/2Pocket-3.jpeg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/2Pocket-3-xs.jpeg 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/2Pocket-3-sm.jpeg 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/2Pocket-3-md.jpeg 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/2Pocket-3-lg.jpeg 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/2Pocket-3-xl.jpeg 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/2Pocket-3-2xl.jpeg 1600w"></figure>The 2Pocket is a split bluetooth keyboard the minimizes it's size by having each half go into each pocket.<p></p><p><strong>What I like most about it:</strong> This is a refined wireless design. The keyboard has top notch documentation and is all around incredibly polished. I additionally, the keyboard adds a pedometer, which I think is is really fun. The keyboard makes use of KMK firmware to add the pedometer support, which is a clever way of quickly adding hardware support to a keyboard project. I think the idea of using you keyboard on the go as much as you use it to type is funny and awesome, and it inpires me to consider making a tamagotchi keyboard that I can use both plugged in and on the go. </p><h3><a href="https://github.com/grassfedreeve/akohekohe">akohekohe</a> (by grassfedreeve)</h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/akohekohe_photo-3.jpg" alt="" width="3354" height="2515" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/akohekohe_photo-3-xs.jpg 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/akohekohe_photo-3-sm.jpg 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/akohekohe_photo-3-md.jpg 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/akohekohe_photo-3-lg.jpg 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/akohekohe_photo-3-xl.jpg 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/akohekohe_photo-3-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>The akohekohe achieves it's small size by having a minimal key layout, only having 26 keys total. In the authors words: "Basically a ZilpZalp with thumbs cut off, and the most comfortable layout I have found."</p><p><strong>What I like most about it: </strong>This design pushes a minimal key layout to it's absolute limits. I love how the keymap is clear for others to see in the repo, as it gives great insperation for how combos can be utilized for a keyboard with only two thumb keys. Additionally, the keyboard supports being wireless.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/corvett21/bonsai">bonsai</a> (by corvette21)</h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/bonsai.png" alt="" width="1208" height="831" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bonsai-xs.png 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bonsai-sm.png 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bonsai-md.png 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bonsai-lg.png 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bonsai-xl.png 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bonsai-2xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>bonsai is a 16 key split wireless keyboard that has an even more reduced keyset, and uses xiao BLEs.</p><p><strong>What I like most about it: </strong>This keyboard provides a great keymap layout of an incredibly minimal keymap, and serves as great inspiration for anyone interested in making their own sub-20 key layouts. The keyboard optionally features a 3 way thumb switch, which is an interesting way of potentially adding new keys/layouts to such a minimal layout. I look forward to seeing a prototype of this design.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/mikeysklar/bubby">bubby</a> (by mikeysklar)</h3><h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/bubby.jpeg" alt="" width="480" height="304" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bubby-xs.jpeg 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bubby-sm.jpeg 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bubby-md.jpeg 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bubby-lg.jpeg 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bubby-xl.jpeg 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/bubby-2xl.jpeg 1600w"></figure></h3><p>bubby is pocket sized choring keyboard that makes use of an esp32-s3 adafruit feather.</p><p><strong>What I like most about it: </strong>This design breaks the normal conventions of a keyboard by exclusively using side buttons. By only having side buttons, the wireless keyboard now becomes possible to use when standing up, walking, or sitting down. I have never seen this kind of approach to a chording keyboard before, and I look forward to this design and idea being futher refined and iterated on. I think it'd be incredibly unique to be able to type while potentially even having your hands <em>in</em> your pockets. I also like the thoughtful case design and utilization of the display. The write up is also phenomenal, and offers a lot of insight to others about lessons learned about handheld chording keyboards. I'd be really interested in hearing what the ARTSEY folks think of this design.</p><h3><a href="https://hackaday.io/project/186263-finch-thumb-keyboard">FiNCH</a> (by wander_over)<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/Finch.jpg" alt="" width="4304" height="2199" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Finch-xs.jpg 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Finch-sm.jpg 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Finch-md.jpg 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Finch-lg.jpg 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Finch-xl.jpg 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/Finch-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></h3><p>FiNCH is a handheld keyboard intended to be used for thumb typing. It features side buttons at the top, as well as a thumbstick in the middle</p><p><strong>What I like most about it:</strong> The FiNCH is the most user friendly keyboard of the bunch. I love the labelled keys, simple layout, and nice case design, since it makes it a approachable pocket board for beginners. I also think that the thumbkey in the middle and side buttons are very nice addons that makes full use of a board intended for thumb typing. Bonus points of clean keycaps for the side buttons!</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/kurt-apple/fixer-otg/tree/main">fixer-otg</a> (by kurt-apple)</h3><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/fixer-otg.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1471" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fixer-otg-xs.jpg 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fixer-otg-sm.jpg 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fixer-otg-md.jpg 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fixer-otg-lg.jpg 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fixer-otg-xl.jpg 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fixer-otg-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><p>fixer-otg is a fork of the <a href="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/idawgs32-how-i-made-a-full-keyboard-for-dollar6.html">idawgz32</a> and <a href="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/bunchiez40-how-i-built-a-keyboard-using-mouse-switches.html">bunchiez40</a>, uses the ultra affordable CH552 microprocessor, and creates a beautiful remix that combines the two ideas, and adds even more ideas on top of it.</p><p><strong>What I like most about it: </strong>The fixer has an incredibly unique and thoughtful approach to key layout. It manages to fit in as many switches as possible without making the keyboard impossible to type on either. To fit in the keys, the keyboard has serveral asymetries to it, which I think make it unique and personally very visually appealing. Another very interesting idea brought to the table is the idea of using an epoxy coating to make the keyboard more durable, which is a really interesting idea for ultraportable keyboards. I would love to read more about this epoxy coating, assuming I haven't already missed it somewhere.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/crides/fusion">fusion</a> (by crides)<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/fusion.jpg" alt="" width="3960" height="1356" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fusion-xs.jpg 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fusion-sm.jpg 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fusion-md.jpg 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fusion-lg.jpg 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fusion-xl.jpg 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/fusion-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure></h3><p>fusion is a wireless keyboard that makes use of folding to achieve it's minimal size</p><p><strong>What I like most about it: </strong>Of all of the diy folding keyboard designs I've seen, fusion is one of the most slim designs. The custom  pcb mount hinges and use of a ribbon cable is a clever way to get make the folding mechnism streamlined. The additon of screen and trackpad is also excellent.</p><h3><a href="https://github.com/tikinson/ToadsTempest">ToadsTempest</a> (by tikinson)<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/ToadsTempestF.JPG" alt="" width="4240" height="2832" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/ToadsTempestF-xs.JPG 300w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/ToadsTempestF-sm.JPG 480w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/ToadsTempestF-md.JPG 768w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/ToadsTempestF-lg.JPG 1024w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/ToadsTempestF-xl.JPG 1360w, https://chrischrislolo.github.io/orthoLabLogs/media/posts/12/responsive/ToadsTempestF-2xl.JPG 1600w"></figure></h3><p>ToadsTempest is a keyboard with acrylic keys and is powered by the CH552T microcontroller.</p><p><strong>What I like most about it: </strong>This keyboard is one of the prettiest I've seen in general. The clear acrylic case and light green buttons make this keyboard truely stunning. This board also provides very interesting insights on click disc mechanisms for buttons, as well as an exploration into click discs. This design offers insight on how to make acrylic buttons, which I think look amazing and incredibly unique. the use of a mirrorable pcb to create a monoblock keyboard is also very interesting :)</p><h2>Winners</h2><p>The choice of picking winners was incredibly difficult given the amount of thought and effort with each one. After some closer deliberation, I've come with the following list of winners:</p><p><strong>Grand prize:</strong> bubby<br><br><strong>Runners up prize:</strong><br>2Pocket<br>ToadsTempest<br>FiNCH<br>Fixer OTG<br><br><strong>Raffle winner prize</strong>: akohehoke</p><p>Thank you to all who have participated!! Each entry has been an incredible exploration of where pocket keyboards can go, as well as unique approaches to minimizing space and size, every contestant should be very proud of what they have created.<br><br>In the next coming months, I will reach out to gather information, and send them to PCBWay for prizes. I will also be assembling the shipping and logistics of prizes shortly.</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>Thank you <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a> for providing their services and prizes to this competition!
